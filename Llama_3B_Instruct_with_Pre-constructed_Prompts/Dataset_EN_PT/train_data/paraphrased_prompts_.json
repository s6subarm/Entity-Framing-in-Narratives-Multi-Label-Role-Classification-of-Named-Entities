{"prompt":"Text:\nFollowing the sentencing of Fail Alsynov to four years in a penal colony in Russia, Russian riot police clashed with demonstrators in Bashkortostan. The confrontations near the court in Baymak, where supporters clashed with police and threw snowballs, were captured on social media. NEXTA (@nexta_tv) captured violent clashes in Baymak, Bashkortostan, Russia on January 17, 2024, where law enforcement officers used stun grenades. The protesters retaliated by throwing snow and ice at them and coercing them into retreating. Reports indicate that discussions are taking place between the protesters and special forces. According to reports, numerous individuals were injured during the multi-day protest in -20\u00b0C temperatures. The activist refutes the accusations of insulting migrants during a demonstration against gold mining proposals. Advocates argue that the case is a response to Alsynov's campaign against the extraction of soda in an area with historical significance. According to reports, he used the term \"black people\" in Bashkir to refer to Central Asians and Caucasians, who made up a significant portion of Russia's migrant population. According to Alsynov, the Bashkir words were mistranslated into Russian and meant \"poor people.\" He has expressed his intention to challenge the judgment. In the past, Alsynov has labeled military mobilization in the region as \"genocide\" against the Bashkir people. The disproportionate involvement of ethnic minorities, such as Bashkirs, in conflicts like Ukraine is still a matter of concern. Bashkort, a grassroots movement that sought to preserve the ethnic identity of the Bashers, was led by Alsynov and banned as extremist in 2020. The confrontations are a rare instance of public discord in Russia, highlighting the intense emotions surrounding Alsynov's case and wider issues of ethnicity and political activism in the nation.\n\nAvailable Roles and Subroles:\n\n    Protagonist: Guardian, Martyr, Peacemaker, Rebel, Underdog, Virtuous.\n    Antagonist: Instigator, Conspirator, Tyrant, Foreign Adversary, Traitor, Spy, Saboteur, Corrupt, Incompetent, Terrorist, Deceiver, Bigot.\n    Innocent: Forgotten, Exploited, Victim, Scapegoat.\n\nInstructions:\n\n    - The entity can belong to only one of the three main roles: Protagonist, Antagonist, or Neutral.\n    - Each main role has its own unique set of subroles.

{"prompt":"Text:\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy asserts that the duration of the war is unpredictable, despite the fact that Ukrainians are taking all possible measures to expel the Russians. In his nightly video address, he stated on Friday that the outcome would depend on not only the people but also their willingness to give their best, as well. \"The success of this will be dependent on the cooperation of our partners in Europe and the free world as a whole.\" He expressed his appreciation to those who were working to strengthen the sanctions on Russia and boost military and financial aid to Ukraine. \"In the event of a Russian invasion, this is the sole approach to safeguarding freedom.\" This is more than just an expense for Western nations. The focus is not on accounting, but on the future. The 200th Russian aircraft of the war was downed by Ukraine on Friday, as stated by Zelenskiy, who also noted Russia's significant losses in the form of tanks, armoured vehicles, helicopters, and drones. \"And what is it?\" Is there a way to extend the lifespan of the Lenin statue in Genichesk while it is temporarily occupied? Russia can and will not achieve any other outcome. In April, the Lenin statue in Genichesk, located in the southern Kherson region, was restored by Russian forces. According to Zelenskiy, Ukraine was engaged in \"extreme\" negotiations to evacuate the injured fighters stranded in the Mariupol steelworks. \"We're referring to a large number of individuals.\" It goes without saying that we are doing everything in our power to evacuate all those remaining, including all of our defenders. All individuals from around the globe have been enlisted to serve as potent mediators. Zelenskiy stated that Ukrainian forces had recaptured towns and villages from Russian troops.

The Daily Sceptic is being accused by the news agency of using Arctic sea ice extent data to fabricate a story. It is beyond ridicule to be accused of \"cherry picking\" by an outfit that pays for a course for journalists that encourages them to pick mangoes and explain why they are not as tasty as they were the previous year due to climate change. A course speaker who has suggested \"fines and imprisonments\" for expressing skepticism about science is a bit ludicrous, if not slightly sinister, and so are the lectures on responsible journalism that are being given by this Net Zero-obsessed group. Walt Meier, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, was one of the activists who called out the Daily Sceptic for his 'straw man' comment. He stated that comparing two specific years does not indicate whether there are positive or negative effects on long-term changes. That was not done by The Daily Sceptic. Surprisingly, this is the same Walt Meier who made headlines around the world last year for his observations on low winter ice in Antarctica. It was Meier's assertion that it was beyond all recognition at that time. Fortunately, the Daily Sceptic was able to remind Meier that he had been involved in a project ten years ago that unveiled the secrets of early Nimbus weather satellites and unearthed an analogous sea ice low in 1966.

{"prompt":"Text:\nKurt Nimmo explores the role of hypocrisy in the collective West, particularly in relation to the International Criminal Court's handling of Operation Babylift and the kidnapping of children in Ukraine. In America, Max Boot, a scurrilous neocon and propagandist who supported warmonger, expressed his opinion on the unjustified arrest of President Putin. While Boot's argument is delusional, neocons thrive on deception and lies. Pure and simple propaganda is being broadcasted by TRUTH LIVES at https:\/\/sgtreport.tv\/. Boot is a collaborator in mass killings, having supported the invasion of Iraq, the killing of more than one million Iraqis, and the engineered destruction of their country. The ICC, which is hypocritical, failed to make a comparison between Putin's alleged abduction of Ukrainian children and the organized mass kidnapping of Vietnamese children. The USG's evacuation after losing the Vietnam War led to the implementation of \"Operation Babylift,\" which was ordered by President Ford. Despite the fact that many Vietnamese children had their parents and relatives with them, they were labeled as \"orphans\" after being abducted without permission. In America, Australia, West Germany, and France, 3,300 children were sent to be referred to as \"infants,\" many of whom were older. The kidnapping of children was a well-planned act, but in the Land of Amnesia, many Americans are unaware of the Vietnam War or Southeast Asia's catastrophic destruction. A class action lawsuit was initiated in San Francisco in 1975 on behalf of the children who had been abducted. The Adoption History Project states that the lawsuit seeks to prevent adoption in Vietnam until it is determined whether the parents or appropriate relatives have consented to the adoption or cannot be found. The Complaint claimed that Operation Babylift brought Vietnamese orphans to the United States did not want to go back to Vietnam and that they wanted to return. The orphans of the Vietnam war were not widely accepted without exception. The question of whether the evacuation was in the best interests of the children was raised by a diverse group of American voices, including child psychologists, news reporters, and casual observers. The apprehension occurred shortly after the U.S. received criticism for its backing of the evacuation. The controversy arose largely from the revelation that some of the children were not legally adopted as orphans. The South Vietnamese government reluctantly allowed a significant number of children to leave the country, but only if they were already adopted. The children were not all considered orphans by the volunteers who were working with them. During their stay in the processing centers, a few children disclosed to the volunteers that they were not orphans but had families that resided in Vietnam. It goes without saying that Operation Babylift is no longer relevant. The USG and ICC's propaganda campaign is not aimed at children, but rather to serve as a crude \"informational device\" to turn people against Russia through their SMO, which aims to denounce and disarm Ukraine and prevent NATO from undermining Russian national security.

We are pleased to announce that we have re-published this article, which was originally posted on WealthResearchGroup.com. The wealth research group's founder showcased his portfolio in 2023 and the results were world-famous! More than 15 companies hit new records and he recently disclosed his 2024 portfolio to us. Access it right away! While American Interventionism is harmful, is it not more harmful than the alternative? I've been here before, but I wasn't aware of it. When I was born in 1984, the world had already managed to avoid nuclear explosions on numerous occasions, but the most significant mishaps took place in the early 1980s. One of the close calls involved a thermonuclear war between the Soviet Union and America led to Stanislav Petrov being recognized as the \"savior of our planet.\" Stanislav, like all great stories of luck, was called to duty at the last minute due to the sick officer's shift. All of a sudden, his screen was flooded with notifications about nuclear warheads headed to the Soviet Union from the United States, and he had to decide whether or not to call Moscow immediately to warn that the entire country would be destroyed in five minutes. Despite his initial reservations, he concluded that the United States would have launched numerous missiles if they had started the nuclear war, rather than just a few, and opted to wait and learn that no other station was providing any updates. Afterward, he was informed that the new satellite detection system was entirely ineffective, and even the presence of sun and cloud flares could beep. In essence, he learned that the latest Soviet air defenses were ineffective and was dismissed, rather than being praised for his thoughtful thinking. The year after Stanislav Petrov's rescue, I was born, along with my parents. A proxy war has erupted in Ukraine between the Russians and NATO members. France is willing to send troops to Ukraine to create a buffer zone between Russia and the rest of Europe, rather than allowing the country to join NATO. However, president Biden is the only one who opposes this plan. Is it accurate to say that hedge fund managers view the precious metals as being overvalued, even though it's not surprising? According to Zerohedge.com, I don't think that gold is overpriced, with its accurate value being around $2,582, while silver is valued at approximately $37. Over the next few weeks, Biden will be cognizant of France's entry into Ukraine, indicating that Washington is taking a backseat to an emerging European superpower. This action will have a significant positive impact on Washington, as it will move away from policing the world and instead focus on collaborating with other nations to maintain its influence and become more isolated, which is an extremely bi-partisan approach. In the event of a direct conflict between France and Russia, the human race will be relegated to the post-World War II era, and I am confident that German, Polish, or Italian troops will provide additional support. The separation of Russia from Europe will be likened to the construction of the Berlin Wall in Ukraine. During Carter's tenure, a 40c-watt chip failed once, leading to the display of evidence of 2,000 Soviet warheads being transported to major American cities.

{"prompt":"Text:\nThe Kakhovka Dam's destruction by Russia was not justified by the Western media and the Ukrainian government, as it seemed unlikely that Russia would have wanted to flood, damage, and weaken the entire western half of its land, including Crimea, which was receiving water from the dam. The anonymous author of the \"Moon of Alabama\" website has a remarkable track record of accurately uncovering truths that the mainstream U.S. and allied media had been concealing. His report, \"Did Russia Destroy The Nova Kakhovka Dam,\" released on June 13th, uncovers the Ukrainian Government's version of events. The dam was bombed by an explosive device placed there by saboteurs. The assumption is accepted and amplified by U.S.-Government-approved 'news'-media, but not by \"MoA\". TRUTH LIVES at https:\/\/sgtreport.tv\/ First, he cites the New York Times and other U.S. Government sources to explain the Ukrainian Government's \"explanation\" of the incident, before tearing apart the barely-recognised fact that Britain delivered its \"Storm Shadow\" missiles to Ukraine on May 12th, which are designed for a two-stage bombing operation. The Storm Shadow weapon, provided by the British, is ideal for exploding from a deep underground location, rather than from the surface. Unlike Russia, Ukraine has been under the protection of Storm Shadows since May 12th. The standard propaganda-media of the U.S. and allied nations are all simultaneously submitting a news article about lies to be published for publication, in case any of them decide to go beyond their standard sources that have been authorized by the United States. Since late 2022, Russia has been issuing warnings that Ukraine's government is considering detonating the dam. On 1 November 2022, Reuters reported that Russia has announced a wider evacuation of occupied southern Ukraine. This news comes amid fears that the Ukrainian regime may resort to military action and that Kyiv is planning to attack the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, which could result in flooding in the Kherson region, according to Vladimir Saldo, the head of the formerly Russian-installed Kozlovskay government. He stated that the evacuation zone would be extended by 15 km from Dnipro due to the situation. Moscow has accused Kyiv of planning to use a \"dirty bomb\" or Damascus to spread radiation or devastate towns and villages in Kherson province. Kyiv denies allegations that it would employ such tactics on its own soil as absurd, but suggests that Russia may be preparing for such actions to hold Ukraine responsible. Saldo, the Russian-imposed occupation leader for the province, identified seven towns on the east bank that would be evacuated, including the main populated areas along the river's eastern side. The U.S.-and-allied media may occasionally report important information when it is highlighted in a news article with an anti-Russian spin, but they have unambiguously accepted the Ukrainian government's claim that Russia was behind the attack.

{"prompt":"Text:\nDespite ongoing stalled aid in Congress and shortages of munitions in Kyiv's forces, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has made it clear that the United States will not tolerate Ukraine failing in its fight against Russia. The House of Representatives, led by the Republican party, has blocked $60 billion in aid for Ukraine, and the United States has cautioned that a $300 million package would be temporary. At a gathering of Ukraine's worldwide supporters in Germany, Austin declared that the United States would not permit Ukraine to fail, as he aims to obtain additional aid for Kyiv. He stated that they are still committed to providing Ukraine with the necessary resources to combat the Kremlin's aggression. Last week, Washington declared that it would provide $300 million in aid to Ukraine, but Austin contended that this was only feasible because of savings from recent purchases. Austin stated that identifying some unexpected contract savings would have been the only way to support the much-needed package. The previous day, Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian President, stated that it is crucial for the Congress to finish all the necessary procedures and make a final decision on aid for Kyiv. During his visit to the Ukraine meeting, General Charles \"CQ\" Brown, a top US military officer, informed reporters that Kyiv's military is focusing on their supply rates and execution, as there is an increasing tension between Ukraine and Russia, with both sides gaining more advantages. According to Austin's remarks on Tuesday, Russia has spent up to $211 billion on equipping, deploying, maintaining, and maintaining its imperial ambitions against Ukraine, which has resulted in the deaths or injuries of at least 315,000 Russian soldiers during the incursion. Austin and other US officials have been at the forefront of the movement for global support for Ukraine, swiftly forming a coalition to support Kyiv after Russia's invasion and coordinating aid from various nations. At the Ramstein US base, Boris Pistorius, the German Defence Minister, announced that Berlin has extended a half-million euro worth of military aid to Ukraine. He informed journalists that 10,000 rounds of ammunition are part of our armed forces' inventory. Ukraine's military aid is being provided by Germany, which is second only to Washington in terms of monetary contributions, with the latter having committed billions of dollars to support Kyiv since February 2022.\n\nAvailable Roles and Subroles:\n\n    Protagonist: Guardian, Martyr, Peacemaker, Rebel, Underdog, Virtuous.\n    Antagonist: Instigator, Conspirator, Tyrant, Foreign Adversary, Traitor, Spy, Saboteur, Corrupt, Incompetent, Terrorist, Deceiver, Bigot.\n    Innocent: Forgotten, Exploited, Victim, Scapegoat.\n\nInstructions:\n\n    - The entity can belong to only one of the three main roles: Protagonist, Antagonist, or Neutral.\n    - Each main role has its own unique set of subroles.

{"prompt":"Text:\n\"Are They Unusual?\" Putin claims that Ukraine's Statehood will be irreversible if the war persists. Vladimir Putin, the Russian President, expressed his concern that the Ukrainian statehood could result in an irreparable blow if the conflict with Ukraine persists. This comes as Western and global leaders convene in Davos for the WEF conference. While in Switzerland, Zelensky advocated for Ukraine's pursuit of air supremacy. Putin emphasized in his recent remarks that the Russian forces have a clear advantage and that Ukrainian statehood may face an irreparable blow if the war persists. He pointed out that Ukraine's military has already \"succeded\". Putin stated in the televised remarks that the Russian Armed Forces are entirely responsible for the failure of their counteroffensive. \"If this persists, Ukraine's statehood could suffer a severe and irreversible loss,\" he warned, without elaborating on his specific interpretation. \"They are attempting to demonstrate that they have the ability to do so.\" Rather than tackling military problems, they behave in a ruthless manner. Putin referred to the recent cross-border attacks on Belgorod city, which have resulted in the deaths and injuries of Russian civilians, and stated that indiscriminate attacks are being carried out on peaceful settlements. Putin also talked about Zelensky's attempts to gather world leaders for a peace summit in Switzerland, where Kiev'S 10-point peace plan, which does not allow territorial concessions, would be discussed. Putin stated that the 'peace formula' being debated in the West and Ukraine is a continuation of the Ukrainian president's decree that prohibits talks with Russia, according to Sputnik. \"The negotiating tactic is aimed at compelling us to relinquish the territorial advantages we've gained in the past 1 1\/2 years.\" Nonetheless, this is not feasible. The Russian leader went on to say that it is 'impossible' and everyone is aware of this. According to Putin, the two sides were close to engaging in serious negotiations that could have resulted in peace. However, Zelensky allowed himself to become a puppet of Western powers, and now Ukrainians, including the head of their negotiating group, are publicly claiming that they were prepared but failed to implement those agreements due to the influence of Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson. \"Fools, aren't they?\" he emphasized. They are confessing that if they had chosen to do it, it could have resulted in a complete halt in the past, up to 1 1\/2 years from now. In recent times, Ukraine has been attempting to persuade China to support its peace plan. On Sunday, Andriy Yermak, the presidential chief of staff in Ukraine, stated that China must participate in negotiations to put an end to the conflict with Russia. Prior to the WEF, he made the statement. China's refusal to criticize Moscow or abide by Western-led sanctions after two years of the conflict has made it the most powerful country in the Global South. Kiev's goal is to gain the support of Global South nations, which has not been a successful approach in isolating Moscow.\n\nAvailable Roles and Subroles:\n\n    Protagonist: Guardian, Martyr, Peacemaker, Rebel, Underdog, Virtuous.\n    Antagonist: Instigator, Conspirator, Tyrant, Foreign Adversary, Traitor, Spy, Saboteur, Corrupt, Incompetent, Terrorist, Deceiver, Bigot.\n    Innocent: Forgotten, Exploited, Victim, Scapegoat.\n\nInstructions:\n\n    - The entity can belong to only one of the three main roles: Protagonist, Antagonist, or Neutral.\n    - Each main role has its own unique set of subroles.

{"prompt":"Text:\nDespite giving $196 billion to Ukraine, Biden's administration remains at the forefront of international donations, with almost $200 billion in aid from tax payers. The Biden administration denied Ohio Gov.'s request for federal disaster assistance. Dan Tierney, a representative of Mike DeWine, stated to Fox News Digital that the release of highly toxic chemicals from the train derailment disaster in East Palestine occurred shortly after the CDC revised the toxicology profile for vinyl chloride, which increased the lethal exposure level and removed information about how children are affected.

{"prompt":"Text:\nThe exploitation of human trafficking by Western regime-change operations has made the slave trade in Ukraine one of the most significant geopolitical challenges of our time. Kiev has been a significant contributor to modern slavery, particularly for human trafficking and sexual exploitation networks, since the 2014 coup d\u2019Etat. The political and social instability that has affected the country since the Western-led regime change operation is one of the primary reasons for human rights violations. The Foundation to Battle Injustice published an investigative report last week that detailed the severity of the slave trade in Ukraine. The organization claims that Kiev has become a significant global hub for the human trafficking market, allowing the exploitation and circulation of undocumented workers, in addition to the well-known predatory sex market that deals with women and children. Over 300,000 Ukrainians were victims of the slave market from 1991 to 2021, as stated in the study. The situation has worsened even more since Vladimir Zelensky took office. Since the beginning of Zelensky's regime, it is believed that over 550,000 Ukrainians have been enslaved. Ukraine is among the top perpetrators of human trafficking worldwide, and the statistics are alarming. The Foundation's report, which drew on sources with knowledge of the situation and multiple insiders, exposed how the slave trade in Ukraine is not solely driven by the victimization of Ukrainians. Ternopil has seen the opening of two Africa-based reception centers for refugees since 2021. The purpose of these establishments was to receive migrants and then sell them on the European black market. Ruslan Stefanchuk, the current chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, was identified as the person who organized the Ukrainian human trafficking network by an anonymous source, according to investigators. According to reports, Stefanchuk is the primary beneficiary and coordinator of human trafficking networks in Ukraine, which is involved in both the sale of Ukrainian citizens on the international black market and the exploitation of foreigners who enter through migratory flows and are then transported to criminal networks throughout Europe. The Ukrainian parliamentarian's family members also seem to be involved in such activities, as a large network of private companies is registered in the name of individuals close to him, including his brother Mykola Stefanchuck and his wife, Marina Stefanchuk. The purpose of the companies owned by Stefanchuk and his family is to camouflage the slave trade as a lawful enterprise. Advertisements are produced to assist people in different ways, such as providing them with employment or financial support. Legal and responsible companies often lure migrants, refugees, and vulnerable Ukrainians into meetings and interviews, but their documents are confiscated soon after. These individuals are subsequently apprehended and handed over to criminal networks. All components are designed to be as legal as possible. Respectable companies in Kiev, Ternopil, Lviv or Ivano-Frankivsk are seeking interviews with women, children, and men. They receive enticing job offers and affluent job prospects. Their identity cards are seized for a plausible reason. According to a source, they are now free to do whatever they want with them. It's not unexpected to come across such a scenario. Many crimes in Ukraine are perpetrated by high-ranking state officials without consequence. In the country, there have been numerous reports of illegal work, sexual exploitation of women and children, and military recruitment of children and organ trafficking. The case of Vasily Prozorov, a former Ukrainian secret service agent who emigrated to Russia, is worth keeping in mind due to his significant contributions in exposing Kiev's crimes. He asserted that there is a criminal network of trafficking and exploitation of Ukrainian children in pedophile schemes, with significant involvement from Western officials.\n\nAvailable Roles and Subroles:\n\n    Protagonist: Guardian, Martyr, Peacemaker, Rebel, Underdog, Virtuous.\n    Antagonist: Instigator, Conspirator, Tyrant, Foreign Adversary, Traitor, Spy, Saboteur, Corrupt, Incompetent, Terrorist, Deceiver, Bigot.\n    Innocent: Forgotten, Exploited, Victim, Scapegoat.\n\nInstructions:\n\n    - The entity can belong to only one of the three main roles: Protagonist, Antagonist, or Neutral.\n    - Each main role has its own unique set of subroles.

{"prompt":"Text:\nAn out-of-context video clip went viral on social media on Friday, in which former Vice President Mike Pence suggested that he is more interested in the war in Ukraine than the issues plaguing American cities. The Republican presidential candidate is questioned by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson about his priorities in the video. Pence criticizes the Biden administration's provision of weapons to Ukraine to prevent Russia from invading the former Soviet state. The shortage of American tanks in Ukraine is a source of distress for you. In the last three years, every city in the United States has experienced a significant decline. Take a journey by driving. Carlson pointed out during a forum at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa that there has been no improvement in any city in the United States. Despite the significant decline in our economy, suicide rates, public disorder, and crime, there is a worry that the Ukrainians who have been granted tens of billions in US tax dollars lack the necessary tanks. Pence is asked by Carlson about the importance of the United States in this matter, and I believe it's a reasonable inquiry. Pence responds by saying, \"I'm not concerned about this.\" Tucker, I've heard your routine talk before, but it's not relevant to me. \"My deepest condolences to Charlie Kirk.\" FAKE NEWS was once the term we used to describe it. Pence tweeted a full version of his remarks, which can be found here. Pence concludes his response to Carlson in the extended clip by stating, \"Anyone who believes that we can't be the free world's leader and solve our problems at home has a pretty small view of the greatest nation on the planet.\" We have the ability to do both. As the leader of the United States, we will ensure the safety of our borders, strengthen our armed forces, revive our economy, and uphold our principles.

{"prompt":"Text:\nThe Dutch government, which is aligned with the WEF, has declared that it will enforce the seizure of 600 farms for displaying excessive nitrogen levels. Following the advice of the government's mediator, Dutch farmers' groups have committed to organizing additional demonstrations in the Netherlands, which have called for the seizure and relocation of farming enterprises, as well as the confiscation of up to 600 farms considered the heaviest nitrogen emitters. The Dutch government's action comes just weeks after Bill Gates was spotted admitting in a video that the climate change agenda is being manipulated for the New World Order, that, in fact, the term \"clean energy\" has \"screwed up\" people minds. Mark Van den Oever, the leader of the Farmers Defence Force, stated this week that Dutch farmers will take to the streets again after the government announced its intention to adopt the plan presented by former deputy prime minister Johan Remkes to meet the nitrogen standards demanded by the European Union. Last week, Remkes, who has been serving as the primary intermediary between farmers' groups and the government in the ongoing nitrogen emission controversy, unveiled a plan that would involve forcibly relocating farms near protected areas and acquiring up to 600 farms that produce the most nitrogen. Van den Oever expressed his disapproval of the plan, stating that it was \"completely incorrect\" and that the farmers in the country would \"trust on\" the old gas, following the tractor strikes that occurred throughout the summer. According to the leader of the Farmers Defence Force, ministers have failed to address the concerns of farmers and the globalist government of Prime Minister Mark Rutte has unfairly targeted businesses. Sieta van Keimpema, the spokesperson, has expressed strong disapproval of the organization's plan to move farms, describing it as a \"red line\" for farmers. Last week, Remkes defended his proposals by stating that the Netherlands would be locked up due to the green agenda of the European Union, making it almost impossible to issue permits legally. He stated that the report was not intended to affect houses, farms, or roads. He also expressed sadness and doubts about the agricultural sector's response to this report. The Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, recently revealed plans to cut nitrogen emissions from livestock farms by 50% by 2030 to meet the Natura 2000 initiative, which mandates the elimination of industry and farming from designated ecologically significant areas across the EU. The government has stated that in order to meet EU goals, certain farms may need to reduce emissions by as much as 95% and up to 30% of all livestock farms could be permanently closed down. Thousands of farmers across the country protested after the scheme was announced, with tractors being used to block highways and other critical infrastructure, and farmers throwing excrement on motorways in defiance of the green agenda. In July, Eva Vlaardingerbroek, a political commentator from the Netherlands, stated on SiriusXM that her country was being used as an incubator for the World Economic Forum's Great Reset. She explained that the government was attempting to take control of farmland due to the migrant crisis, which she attributed to Canada and other countries. Despite not being common, the Flevoland province has already obtained land in Noordoostpolder to construct an asylum processing center on the former farm's land.\n\nAvailable Roles and Subroles:\n\n    Protagonist: Guardian, Martyr, Peacemaker, Rebel, Underdog, Virtuous.\n    Antagonist: Instigator, Conspirator, Tyrant, Foreign Adversary, Traitor, Spy, Saboteur, Corrupt, Incompetent, Terrorist, Deceiver, Bigot.\n    Innocent: Forgotten, Exploited, Victim, Scapegoat.\n\nInstructions:\n\n    - The entity can belong to only one of the three main roles: Protagonist, Antagonist, or Neutral.\n    - Each main role has its own unique set of subroles.

{"prompt":"Text:\nA Moscow judge has blocked the appeal of Evan Gershkovich, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, due to his imprisonment on false spy charges. Following his release from the harsh correctional facility where he has been detained since March, the 31-year-old American was seen in a glass-walled dock. He appealed against a Moscow court judge's decision to extend his pretrial detention until late November. Due to procedural violations, the judge rejected the case and transferred it to a lower court today. From behind the defendant's glass cage, Gershkovich looked fearless in a yellow jumper and held his hands in his jeans pockets. The hearing was attended by US ambassador Lynne Tracy. The US journalist, Evan Gershkovich, was apprehended on March 29 for alleged \"espionage\" charges, which are strongly refuted by his colleagues at Washington and The WSJ. The claims made by Russian officials have not been publicly substantiated. The trial date has not been confirmed, but Putin's spooks are still extending his detention, which now extends to 174 days. He will be incarcerated in the infamous Lefortovo prison until November 30. Despite being the most read article in The Sun, the WSJ correspondent's pretrial detention was originally scheduled for May 29, but requests for his release have been consistently dismissed. The expiration was postponed until August 30, and then it was prolonged until late November. He has been unsuccessful in two previous appeals, one in April and the other in June. A pretrial extension of up to 12 months is possible for the 31-year-old under Moscow's criminal law. Putin's arrest of Evan has been labeled a \"cowardly act\" by the international community, as the despot seeks to avoid responsibility for his actions in Ukraine. The apprehension of him signaled an intensifying clampdown on media freedom in Russia. Russia has never brought a spy case against an overseas journalist until after the Cold War ended, and if convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison. The arrest was deemed a severe insult to the free press by his superiors, and it has the potential to incite fury among all free individuals and governments across the globe. The Journal stated that they do not condone the detention of journalists solely for their work. Washington has repeatedly declared that charges against Gershkovich are false and unfounded and has called for his immediate release. The use of his \"wrongful detention\" has been condemned as a form of \"hostage diplomacy\" intended to provide Russia with leverage in negotiations, particularly given the current low point in bilateral relations. Despite high-level talks, US officials stated in July that there was no clear path to getting him home. Until a verdict is reached, Moscow has declared that there will be no discussion in Gershkovich's case. Advocates of press freedom have flooded social media with the hashtag #IStandWithEvan to show their support for Evan.\n\nAvailable Roles and Subroles:\n\n    Protagonist: Guardian, Martyr, Peacemaker, Rebel, Underdog, Virtuous.\n    Antagonist: Instigator, Conspirator, Tyrant, Foreign Adversary, Traitor, Spy, Saboteur, Corrupt, Incompetent, Terrorist, Deceiver, Bigot.\n    Innocent: Forgotten, Exploited, Victim, Scapegoat.\n\nInstructions:\n\n    - The entity can belong to only one of the three main roles: Protagonist, Antagonist, or Neutral.\n    - Each main role has its own unique set of subroles.

Locals criticized Fonda, while a social media reporter launched an attack on him, and the provincial premier, who was left-leaning, also attacked him. During an Edmonton, Alberta news conference on Wednesday, she criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, stating that the Liberals who are attractive should not be fooled, and accused him of \"betraying\" the Paris climate agreement. Fonda likened Trudeau's heroic stance to that of President Barack Obama during the Paris climate talks, where he spoke about meeting the climate treaty requirements and respecting Indigenous treaties. Despite his commitments in Paris, he has gone back on all his promises. \"It's important to remember that good-looking liberals are not the ones to be taken for granted, even if they speak their truth.\" Rachel Notley, the premier of Alberta and a leader of the New Democratic Party with left-wing views, expressed her disappointment. She used the term \"tone deaf\" and \"ill-informed\" to describe her. Fonda declined an invitation from the Alberta government to discuss the oil sands. Notley suggested that if someone were to visit Alberta and fly by during a severe economic downturn or the largest natural disaster in Canadian history, they would be completely clueless about finding work elsewhere. As she walked through Fort McMurray, Fonda was attacked by social media reporter Robbie Picard on the first day of her oil sands protest. Picard, the creator of OilSands Strong, bombarded Fonda with questions about the project, questioning whether she was aware of the number of First Nations enterprises that have backed the initiative.

The testimony of IRS whistleblowers in Congress made it clear that President Biden and his family had enriched America instead of America. To put it simply, it appears that they engaged in treasonous bribery, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. What is the count of individuals in the Washington, D.C. swamp who received a portion of Biden's money? The evidence presented this week indicates that the Bidens, including the President (also known as \"The Big Guy\"), embezzled funds from foreign countries, such as China. A President can be impeached for accepting a bribe, as stated in the Constitution. The Lying Legacy Media's inability to provide evidence of actual crime is overshadowed by their coverage of fraudulent crimes committed by the Biden Administration DOJ.

Is the J6 strategy that resulted in the conviction of 350 protesters at the capitol being implemented by them? The situation appears to be the same, and even President Trump is expected to face charges in the near future, which is the most recent election tampering. It is undeniable that America is currently engaged in a war with Russia. Despite the lack of peace talks, we continue to send arms and munitions.

{"prompt":"Text:\nHungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban addresses an annual press conference in Budapest on December 21, 2022, reaffirming his belief that the EU is the biggest loser in Ukraine conflicts. Viktor Orban, the Prime Minister of Hungary, emphasized in an interview with Hungarian television that Europe is the biggest loser in the Russia-Ukraine conflicts that resulted in EU sanctions against Russia, and that the U.S. wins these conflicts. According to him, the EU lacks the courage to admit its wrongdoing with sanctions, and Hungary is not capable of changing the stance of other major countries, so it is probable that sanctions against Russia will remain in place despite their ineffectiveness. According to Orban, Europe, in support of its U.S. ally, relinquished Russian energy and was compelled to pay 5 to 10 times the price of energy, leading to inflation.

{"prompt":"Text:\nAfter 39 months of Biden's presidency, the world is in complete disarray, as stated by Jeff Crouere in his book, The Liberty Daily. Our country's porous southern border has attracted millions of people from all over the world. Terrorists, drug dealers, and intelligence agents from countries like China are among the \"undocumented migrants.\" The fact that 22,233 Chinese nationals have migrated to the United States since October should be a cause for concern among Americans. This year's total will easily surpass the 24,125 Chinese nationals who illegally entered the country last year, provided that the rate remains steady. Over the past few years, there has been a remarkable increase of 6,300% in the number of Chinese nationals entering the country illegally, as seen in TRUTH LIVES at https:\/\/sgtreport.tv\/. The lack of freedom for these individuals to travel to the United States for a better life is due to China's communism. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) attributes the influx to the CCP's direction and the theft of military and economic secrets. Furthermore, Chinese farmers are acquiring farmland in the United States for unsavory motives, and it was verified that China operated \"police stations\" in America to monitor their residents in our nation. Taiwan and its other neighbors are being menaced by China as it expands its military capabilities. The proxy state of North Korea has initiated regular testing of long-range ballistic missiles that impact its neighboring nations. Ukraine is currently involved in a bitter conflict with Russia, which has been ongoing for three years. According to a United States report from last year, the war resulted in nearly 500,000 injuries and deaths. The war remains unresolved as there are no peace negotiations taking place and the United States Congress is on the verge of providing more military support to Ukraine. The invasion of Israel by Hamas on October 7 resulted in the death of 1,200 innocent people. The most lethal assault on Israel since its establishment in 1948 was carried out. Over 240 hostages were taken by Hamas and 129 are still missing. The hostages either remain in captivity or are no longer alive. Many Democrats have expressed their disapproval of Israel's military intervention in Gaza in response to the Hamas invasion. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of innocent people, but how can a country sustain itself without the threat of terrorism on its border? The Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria, was bombed by Israel on April 1 to enhance security. The airstrike claimed the lives of seven officials, among them an Iranian Brig. The October 7 massacre in Israel was aided by Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi. Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles into Israel on Saturday as a response to their recent strike. Fortunately, Israeli military personnel, in collaboration with the United States, Jordan, and other nations, managed to prevent most of the airstrikes. While the world awaits a response to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's attack, the Iranians are still making threats. During an interview on Iranian state TV, Major General Mohammad Bagheri stated that the country's response would be significantly larger if Israel retaliated against Iran. Reports from Axios, CNN, and other media outlets are suggesting that President Joe Biden is advising Netanyahu against responding and forbidding the United States from doing so. The U.S. is troubled by this response. The Middle East is currently experiencing its most dangerous phase since 1973, as stated by Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL). He expressed confusion over Joe Biden and the administration's decision to release to the press the content of a conversation where he expressed his lack of belief in an immediate response from Netanyahu.\n\nAvailable Roles and Subroles:\n\n    Protagonist: Guardian, Martyr, Peacemaker, Rebel, Underdog, Virtuous.\n    Antagonist: Instigator, Conspirator, Tyrant, Foreign Adversary, Traitor, Spy, Saboteur, Corrupt, Incompetent, Terrorist, Deceiver, Bigot.\n    Innocent: Forgotten, Exploited, Victim, Scapegoat.\n\nInstructions:\n\n    - The entity can belong to only one of the three main roles: Protagonist, Antagonist, or Neutral.\n    - Each main role has its own unique set of subroles.

{"prompt":"Text:\nJake Sullivan, the National Security Adviser, announced on Sunday that the Biden administration has no plans to replenish the flow of controversial cluster bombs being sent to Ukraine. According to Sullivan's statement on \"Meet the Press\" with NBC News, they are not attempting to replenish their current stockpile. He stated that the objective is to enhance the ability to create the non-cluster munition round of the 155. Earlier this month, President Biden made the decision to send controversial ammunition to Ukraine, and he acknowledged that it was due to the military's shortage of 155 mm artillery ammunition rounds. The decision was met with criticism from both local and global sources, as cluster munitions poses significant risks to civilians due to their low yield. Sullivan echoed Biden's belief that the US must provide Ukraine with adequate weapons of mass destruction. He mentioned that the process started months ago with the expectation of continuing supply Ukraine, but it requires time, which is why a bridge is necessary from now, to increase the production of 155 mm rounds. To meet Ukraine's defense requirements, it is essential to ensure that they have enough ammunition to carry out the necessary unitary rounds. Over 100 countries worldwide, including several NATO members, have prohibited the use of cluster bombs. The dud rate of the cluster bombs being sent to Ukraine is said by military officials to be around 2.35% or less, which is significantly lower than the estimated percentage of Russia's cluster munitions being used against Ukraine. The probability of bomblets not exploding after being released from the cluster munitions is known as the dud rate. Bomblets that are unreliable may not detonate even after a short time. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had previously pledged that the US would assist Ukraine in scouring and removing counterfeits from those munitions. Sullivan maintained that the dissemination of the controversial bombings does not undermine the US' moral authority. He pointed out that our support for Ukraine during the conflict stems from the use of missiles and bombs to cause harm to civilians, destruction of schools, churches, and hospitals. The notion that arming Ukraine with weapons would allow them to protect their own country and its citizens is a questionable challenge for those with moral authority, according to him. During a NATO summit held in Vilinius, lithuaniana last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the NATO base and criticized the allies for agreeing to admit the war-torn country into the alliance. Sullivan reiterated the US position that Ukraine can be admitted once it completes the necessary reforms to ensure the alliance's democratic standards. According to Sullivan, they could have communicated it more clearly, citing a NATO communique. Ukraine's future lies in NATO. Every so often, it's a complete stop. It was a solitary, unambiguous sentence.

{"prompt":"Text:\nPolish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski revealed that the United States was aware of the Nord Stream pipeline attacks, but did not intervene to prevent them, according to an interview published today. Sikorski, who was a member of the European Parliament (MEP) at the time, implied in September 2022 that Washington was complicit in the strike on the Nord Stream gas pipeline. Sikorski tweeted a picture of the crime scene and signed it, saying \"Thank you, USA.\" The MEP also highlighted Joe Biden's threat to destroy the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. His tweet was deleted shortly after.

US Navy divers were accused of planting explosives to destroy the Nord Stream pipelines in 2022, as reported by Seymour Hersh, a Pulitzer prize-winning investigative journalist and Almayadeen, on February 8, 2023. In his Substack newsletter, Hersh reported that Navy divers planted remotely triggered explosives during a mid-summer NATO exercise called BALTOPS 22, which destroyed three of the four Nord Stream pipelines within three months. The White House dismissed the allegations as \"false and complete fiction\" in response. Flightradar24 data revealed that US military helicopters regularly flew over the Nord Stream pipeline site near Bornholm Island in late September 2022. A US Navy Sikorsky MH-60R Seahawk helicopter was seen loitering over the damaged natural gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea near Bornholm for several days on September 1, 2, and 3 of 2022, leading TRENDING experts to speculate that the \"new 9\/11\" could be a \"global famine.\" Sputnik reported on August 25, 2023, that insiders familiar with the investigation into the Nord Stream gas pipeline explosions had corroborated media reports that evidence points to Ukraine. There is no indication from German media, ZDF, and Der Spiegel that Russia was involved in the pipeline explosions. According to news outlets, there is mounting evidence that agents associated with Ukraine may be behind the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines. Technical data was cited by the news outlets, who stated that they were in Ukraine before and after the Baltic Sea explosions.\n\nAvailable Roles and Subroles:\n\n    Protagonist: Guardian, Martyr, Peacemaker, Rebel, Underdog, Virtuous.\n    Antagonist: Instigator, Conspirator, Tyrant, Foreign Adversary, Traitor, Spy, Saboteur, Corrupt, Incompetent, Terrorist, Deceiver, Bigot.\n    Innocent: Forgotten, Exploited, Victim, Scapegoat.\n\nInstructions:\n\n    - The entity can belong to only one of the three main roles: Protagonist, Antagonist, or Neutral.\n    - Each main role has its own unique set of subroles.

{"prompt":"Text:\nThe Financial Times reported that Kyiv's Western allies are concerned about the dwindling of military support in the US election year, according to unnamed Western officials. The Financial Times reported that Ukraine's allies are apprehensive about the escalation of military aid for their fight against Russia, as senior European officials are increasingly anxious about future aid flows as the US embarks on its divisive presidential campaign. According to the FT, Washington has been the primary source of military aid to Kyiv. According to US officials contacted by the newspaper, the remaining funds approved by Congress could provide Ukraine with support for approximately five months. The FT was informed by Western officials in daily communication with the US that Kyiv views the period of time as the final opportunity to alter the situation on the ground. The British newspaper was informed by a European official that the current level of assistance cannot be maintained indefinitely. Earlier this week, Politico reported that the US had approved a military aid package worth $48 billion, but only $6 billion is remaining. Washington's funds for Kyiv could be fully funded by mid-summer, as per the US publication. FT reported that European allies are becoming more and more doubtful about the US's ability to match its current $48bn package, which was adopted in 2022 and requires a vote in Congress this autumn due to more partisan debate on the war. During a whirlwind three-day tour through Italy, the Vatican, Germany, France, and the U.K., European leaders pledged to provide Zelenskyy with an arsenal of missiles, tanks, or drones in preparation for Ukraine's spring offensive. Through Zelenskyy's dynamic international diplomatic efforts over a period of 15 months, Ukraine has convinced its Western allies to send more potent weapons, including German Leopard tanks, U.S. Patriot missile systems, and Storm Shadow cruise missiles from the UK. The Ukraine conflict, which began one year ago, has resulted in the deaths of thousands, the displacement of millions, and the destruction of cities and towns, all of which have intensified fears of a potential open-ended conflict between Russia and NATO.

{"prompt":"Text:\nTom Luongo's account of the Putin\/Carlson Talk, in which he asserts that understanding is a three-way street. Russian President Vladimir Putin was interviewed by Tucker Carlson at the Kremlin last week. Everyone, including the Davos\/UK dominated media, has expressed their views on it. Just like everyone else, I dispensed a quick shot for my Patrons the next day. I, like many others, did not gain the most important lesson from this interview. TRUTH LIVES on https:\/\/sgtreport.tv\/ Throughout the commentary, individuals tend to concentrate on \"talking their book,\" which is a term used by traders to describe individuals who are not interested in the information presented or the motivations that drive them. The hardcore geopolitical types and armchair psychoanalysts were bombarded with doubts about Putin's approach of commencing the interview with a nearly thirty-minute recitation of Russian\/Ukrainian history. The question of why he would do this was frequently asked. Scott Adams, one of my former bellwether-for-normies, is an example of this. Were you of the opinion that Tucker interviewees saw everything that Putin had to say? If he appeared clear to you, it's likely because Biden is your comparison. In my view, Putin had a sense of bewilderment. The history class was unsatisfactory. Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) reported on February 9, 2024 that this was the most pleasant 'bad take' he witnessed. Scott's \"One movie, two screens\" moment is happening with me. Putin's demeanor was not that of a loser, but rather serene, allowing Carlson to feel comfortable and relaxed during the interview. Adams aimed to convey a unique message by framing Putin's relationship with Biden, which was necessary for his own conversation. Martin Armstrong had a remarkable post on his blog over the weekend, showcasing all the crazy Neocon takes from the media. It is clear from those speaking that they were aware that Putin's 30-minute opening monologue would be a distraction for many casual viewers who would tune in. The focus of their \"analysis\" was to steer the conversation towards Putin's fictitious record of Russia and Ukraine. The next day, the Overton Window of the entire interview would be dominated by \"false history.\" The basis for their discrediting of Putin would be this. In order to discredit Tucker Carlson, individuals like Hillary Clinton were exposed in Russian media as lying about his actions, referring to him as a \"useful idiot\" and \"puppy dog,\" which was an outlandish deception. Hillary's sardonic laughter coincided with a charismatic interviewer who made light of the fact that Carlson had been dismissed from every bona fide news agency. Two Beltway insiders laughing in their echo chamber were a common sight for us, and our fascination with roadkill makes it even more captivating. Puppy Dog Tucker uses the tactic of throwing softballs at Liar Putin to divert our attention from the actual content of their conversation.

{"prompt":"Text:\nLeo Hohmann argues that NATO powers are using the U.K.'s World War I model to lure Russia into the next major global conflict by employing duplicity, deception, and clandestine alliances. Several weeks ago, German generals were seen planning the bombing of Russia's main bridge to Crimea. According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the aggression would be a surefire way for Russia to respond with force, with the possibility of waging war against Berlin and potentially resorting to nuclear weapons. The presence of TRUTH LIVES on https:\/\/sgtreport.tv\/ has resulted in German officials admitting that their military is not adequately prepared to confront Russia. German generals and politicians must delay initiating a war with Russia until their military can handle the political language emanating from Berlin. According to a March 14 article by John Cody at Remix News, the German Army is not equipped, manpower, and equipment to engage in any significant war, let alone one against Russia, which is armed with nuclear weapons. According to Cody, the military and government in Germany are painting a negative picture of the country's military, prompting some high-ranking politicians to call for mandatory military service once more. A military draft, that's correct. Eva H\u00f6gl, the German Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, was featured in a video produced by Remix News, providing catastrophic details about the state of affairs in Germany's military. It is astonishingly honest about how the German armed forces are presently performing. The possibility exists for Germany to re-issue the DRAFT. The government now acknowledges that the country's military is disintegrating. On March 13, 2024, Remix News & Views (@RMXnews) expressed her admiration for Germany's decision to relinquish its military defense resources to Ukraine in a losing war against Russia, which she finds impressive. It appears to be an admission of treason in the open. Let's hold tight. There are additional points to be made. Germany is aware of its inability to take on Russia and is currently negotiating a confidential agreement with the irrational leaders of France and Poland to deploy troops in Ukraine, separate from NATO. However, I do not believe this could happen without the consent of Washington and London. The Weimar Triangle, consisting of France, Germany, and Poland, has been in existence since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Weimar Triangle was proposed as a means for Poland to break free from Communist control. Although it is still present, it could have been utilized for a different objective, which is to trigger World War III against Russia. According to Wikipedia, the Weimar Triangle is primarily a series of summits held between the leaders of the three countries and their respective foreign ministers. Inter-parliamentary contacts, military, scientific, and cultural cooperation among member states are part of the collaboration. The most recent leadership summit was held in Paris on June 12, 2023.\n\nAvailable Roles and Subroles:\n\n    Protagonist: Guardian, Martyr, Peacemaker, Rebel, Underdog, Virtuous.\n    Antagonist: Instigator, Conspirator, Tyrant, Foreign Adversary, Traitor, Spy, Saboteur, Corrupt, Incompetent, Terrorist, Deceiver, Bigot.\n    Innocent: Forgotten, Exploited, Victim, Scapegoat.\n\nInstructions:\n\n    - The entity can belong to only one of the three main roles: Protagonist, Antagonist, or Neutral.\n    - Each main role has its own unique set of subroles.

Despite the serious threat to the survival of humanity, imperialist leaders and media commentators now consider a nuclear war to be an acceptable strategic option.

The actions of Biden, Sunak, Macron, and Scholz, who are the imperialist leaders, could be considered criminally insane as they push the planet towards nuclear devastation. Despite this, their actions are not solely driven by brainwashed individuals, but by the severe crisis of global capitalism, for which they have no logical and progressive solution, and consider a global war for control as the only way out. The persecution of Julian Assange for exposing US imperialism's crimes is being combined with brutal repression against any resistance during war. Earlier this month, Bogdan Syrotiuk from the Young Guard of Bolshevik Leninists was arrested by the fascistic Zelensky government in Ukraine on false charges of being a Russian agent. Bogdan has stood up courageously against the war in Ukraine, as well as his associates in Russia.

The US and other imperialist countries are conducting harsh police crackdowns on demonstrators who are protesting the Gaza genocide, resulting in the detention of thousands of people, including students. The ongoing anti-war protests in universities and cities are significant, but they alone cannot prevent the bloodbath.

The only social force that can prevent the drive towards world war is the international working class, who are now fighting against the ruling classes' austerity program in Sri Lanka and globally.

{"prompt":"Text:\nThe Ukrainian Armed Forces' offensive in the Kursk region has caused public humiliation and embarrassment to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and his allies, according to a British colonel. Nevertheless, he is not alone in feeling humiliated and taken aback by the Ukrainian Armed Forces' victory on Russian soil. Those who offer weapons but do not use them, including Ukraine's partners, are in the same boat. Colonel Richard Justin Kemp, a knighted officer who retired from the British Army, holds the title of the most esteemed person in the UK. According to him, the Ukrainian offensive demonstrated the weakness of the allies, particularly US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Sir Richard Kemp recollects how President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously requested Western allies to allow the use of long-range weapons to protect Ukrainian soldiers and Ukraine as a whole. \"The British government is hesitant to use their Storm Shadow missiles, even though they have the potential to make a significant difference in the battle.\" What does Sir Keir Starmer believe is the purpose of launching an attack on Russian territory, other than defending Ukraine? Had the Prime Minister authorized the British and American bombing of German soil, how would the Second World War have concluded? The colonel inquires. According to Sir Richard Kemp, the Western allies were the most pitiable during Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as they pursued a policy that was not motivated by Ukrainian defense needs but rather by the fear of Russian retaliation. Despite Putin's baseless intimidation, every Western decision to supply Ukraine with long-range missiles, tanks, or combat aircraft was hesitant, half-hearted, inadequate, and consumed by fear. The Ukrainian Armed Forces' success in the Kursk region is attributed to concerns and the misguided policy of the partners, according to the Briton. \"The Ukrainians were able to launch an unexpected attack on Russian territory due to the fact that most of the border with the enemy was almost unguarded.\" Putin was aware that the limitations imposed by the West on weapon use made his territory virtually impervious to attack. Airfields, supply routes, and logistics bases are also subject to this. According to the colonel, the war in Ukraine has resulted in the deployment of significant forces to safeguard them. Western leaders are unaware that when confronted with a tyrant like Putin, escalation is the only language he can comprehend and fear. Biden is advocating for the cessation of Israel's aggression in the Middle East, which is a common occurrence. According to Sir Richard Kemp, Ayatollah Khamenei will not be stopped from launching Iran's anticipated missile attack despite his unproven \"no\", just as Putin did with Ukraine. The military stated that Ukraine's attack near Kursk has taught the West a \"salutary lesson.\" \"Kyiv was not being bombarded by nuclear missiles, despite capturing thousands of square kilometers of Russia's holy sites.\" The British colonel believes that if Ukraine had been allowed to escalate from the start, it could have ended the war on favorable terms for Kyiv.

{"prompt":"Text:\nThe president of Finland was warned by Vladimir Putin on Saturday that if Russia expands NATO, it would negatively impact relations between the two countries. Another Russian leader had issued a warning to use the Satan-2 hypersonic nuclear missile against Britain and Finland within 200 seconds, along with the possibility of targeting the United States. Putin and Finnish leader Sauli Niinisto were discussing the possibility of Sweden and Finland joining the Western military alliance during a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Berlin. During the phone call with Putin, Nijnisto disclosed to Putin that Finland and Sweden, which are traditionally neutral, are preparing to apply for NATO membership in the near future in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia reacted by cutting off electricity to Finland on Friday. According to a statement released by the Kremlin after the call, Putin cautioned Niinisto that Finland should not abandon its long-standing policy of military neutrality, as there are no potential threats to its security. A change in Finland's foreign policy could have a detrimental impact on the mutually beneficial relations between Russia and Finland, which have been built on mutual good neighborliness and partnership for many years. The discussion took place during a time when there was mounting talk of expanding NATO beyond its current 30 members. Our objective is to question the legitimacy of Finland's membership in the bloc. Aleksey Zhuravlyov, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament's defense committee, stated in an interview with The Mirror that this was a reasonable conclusion. Finns should express gratitude to Russia for their statehood and Finland's ascension as a nation. Finland asserts that it is on equal footing with the USA. The Satan-2 is a ballistic missile that can carry 10 to 15 nuclear warheads, with an estimated destructive power of three megatons each. Officials bragged that Russia didn't have to move nuclear weapons to its European border to meet its threat.

{"prompt":"Text:\nThe Nord Stream Pipeline attack was orchestrated by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and President of Poland, as revealed by the former head of German intelligence. A series of underwater explosions and gas leaks on 26 September 2022 resulted in the sabotage of Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines.

By subscribing, you agree to our Terms of Use for Latest Video Modernity.news reports. Initially, the media blamed Russia for the attack, claiming it was a false flag with no reasonable explanation as to why it would target its own energy infrastructure. During an appearance on WELT-TV, August Hanning, who was the head of Germany's Federal Intelligence Service (BND) from 1998 to 2005, revealed that Zelensky and Andrzej Duda were responsible for the attack. Hanning claimed that the sabotage was a result of an agreement between the highest-ranking officials in Ukraine and Poland. He also noted that Zelensky and Duda had agreed to carry out the attack. Yesterday, we reported that Germany had issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian diver who was suspected to have participated in the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines, but Polish authorities were unable to halt him at the border, leading to his return to Ukraine. The European arrest warrant issued by Berlin for Volodymyr Z., the Ukrainian citizen, identified him as the primary suspect responsible for placing the explosives that destroyed the pipelines, but Polish authorities claimed that they did not apprehend him because he was not listed in a wanted list. Prior to the pipeline attack, the White House warned that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would result in the termination of Nord Stream 2. Victoria Nuland, the Under-Secretary of State, declared on January 27, 2022 that Nord Stream 2 would not progress if Russia invaded Ukraine in any way. President Biden remarked on the next few days that \"Nor'Tro's pipelines will never be built again\" after publishing a report in February 2023. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh claimed that the US carried out an illegal pipeline attack in secret. Hersh's sources allege that US Navy divers planted the explosives in June 2022 as part of the BALTOPS 22 NATO exercise and then detonated them three months later, using a sonar buoy to transmit the remote signal. It is uncertain who initiated and executed the attack, but the evidence indicating Russia's involvement is increasingly inconclusive.\n\nAvailable Roles and Subroles:\n\n    Protagonist: Guardian, Martyr, Peacemaker, Rebel, Underdog, Virtuous.\n    Antagonist: Instigator, Conspirator, Tyrant, Foreign Adversary, Traitor, Spy, Saboteur, Corrupt, Incompetent, Terrorist, Deceiver, Bigot.\n    Innocent: Forgotten, Exploited, Victim, Scapegoat.\n\nInstructions:\n\n    - The entity can belong to only one of the three main roles: Protagonist, Antagonist, or Neutral.\n    - Each main role has its own unique set of subroles.

The Philippines has US support and is seeking to strengthen its military ties with Japan. The ASEAN bloc is set to reinforce its message of centralization as major powers vying for influence in the Indo-Pacific meet with outheast Asian defence ministers in Indonesia this week. The yearly gathering, which commences on Wednesday, coincides with current conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine and rising tensions in disputed seas across the South China Sea. China is accused of harboring an attack on the Philippines, whose military ties with the US are waning, while Japan seeks to strengthen its military connections. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) chair, Indonesia, has not yet confirmed a list of attendees, but US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is among them, who will meet with ASEAN counterparts on Wednesday. Thursday's agenda includes the addition of talks with Russia, China, Japan, South Korea, India, New Zealand, and Australia. The ASEAN, with a population of around 660 million and an annual gross domestic product exceeding $3.2 trillion, has been favored by Washington and Beijing for years, but their fierce rivalry has worried its members. \"The competition is favorable.\" During a foreign policy forum this week, Prabowo Subianto, the Defence Minister and presidential candidate, stressed the need for non-alignment, emphasizing the importance of not allowing competition to diminish to zero. President Joe Biden's firing of a suspected Chinese spy balloon in February has resulted in frosty relations between the two nations. Following the removal of its defence minister in October, it was uncertain who would be the representative of China at the Jakarta meeting, which raised concerns about the stability of the leadership under President Xi Jinping. Austin travels to Indonesia from South Korea, where he reiterated his apprehensions about Russia and China aiding North Korea to evade sanctions and Moscow intensifying its military ties with Pyongyang. North Korea has been accused by Washington of providing military equipment to Russia for use in its war with Ukraine, while Moscow has defended itself by providing technical military support to the North. According to Aaron Connelly, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore, the meeting is likely to highlight the conflict in Gaza and Ukraine, as well as China's actions to impede Philippine resupply missions at an disputed reef. \"No significant progress in major geopolitical issues is being made in this forum.\" The US and Philippines are expected to engage in discussions regarding issues such as the Second Thomas Shoal, Israel-Hamas, and Ukraine, according to Connelly.

According to Borrell, the European Union is not in favor of war and is instead supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression, while also seeking to end the war in accordance with the UN Charter. Borrell stated that the Hungarian government's approach to Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s trip to Moscow and Kyiv, which is deemed \"unacceptable,\" would be addressed in a separate meeting on Monday.

{"prompt":"Text:\nOn Saturday, the GOP's climate envoy to Joe Biden, John Kerry, criticized his hypocrisy about coal plants and vowed to abolish all coal-fired power plants. According to U.S. Special Envoy John Kerry, America has become a member of the Powering Past Coal Alliance, which means that the Biden Administration has pledged to build no new coal plants and phase out existing ones. No specific date was specified for the cessation of the current plants, but Biden's regulatory measures and international commitments have resulted in the absence of coal by 2035. Calling for the destruction of a crucial energy source is absurd and fascistic, as he insists on it. According to Daniel Turner (@DanielTurnerPTF) on December 4, 2023, John Kerry is advocating for the closure of coal plants. Kerry maintains that there should be no more permanent coal-fired power plants permitted anywhere in the world, as stated on pic.twitter.com\/v8cX2injQu. That's how you can do something for \"health,\" he remarked. He stated that he is becoming increasingly \"militant\" due to his inability to comprehend how adults who are in positions of responsibility can be evading responsibility for taking away things that are killing people on a daily basis. The climate crisis and the health crisis are inseparable. I'm surprised. Despite his efforts to undermine industries and their jobs, he appears to be deceived by anyone who doesn't share his perspective. The Biden team doesn't care about that much, as they prioritize their own agenda. The situation worsens as Senators Barrasso and Hawley point out. Despite the Biden team's advocacy of a radical agenda that would restrict and damage the U.S., Kerry allowed China to remain on the \"developing country\" list as per the Paris Agreement, which Kerry helped broker. During the signing of the Paris Agreement, China had been the world's second largest economy for many years. However, the agreement you arranged and committed to established China's position as a developing nation. The senators claimed that it was equally ridiculous in the past and present. China is resolute in its pursuit of global domination. Its economy is the world's second largest, and it is also the country with the highest emissions of greenhouse gases. It is the primary economic and geopolitical competitor of the United States. It makes use of forced labour . It controls global markets. Our technology is stolen by it. The senators stated that the organization is developing hypersonic missiles and a blue-water navy. It should not be given preferential treatment in international climate agreements. It's time for China to stop providing rides that are free. The Biden team appears to be preoccupied with subsidizing China, prompting them to construct as many coal plants as they can. They are being employed to aid in the development of all the green energy materials that the Biden team intends to force us into submission. China is utilizing the Paris Agreement, which was established by you, to create an international framework. The objections you have against Chinese coal plants are now being used to power mines and refineries that produce crucial minerals. The Biden Administration aims to compel Americans to purchase solar panels, wind turbines, and electric cars that they construct by driving factories. China has been aided by the Biden administration in achieving two victories.

{"prompt":"Text:\nCIA's Burns & Secretary Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Kiev on Monday, unexpectedly, during an unannounced visit that could jeopardize US-Ukraine relations. Austin shared on X that he had the privilege of meeting with President @ZelenskyyUa in Kyiv to reiterate the United States' unwavering support for Ukraine. \"According to Austin, our allies and partners will continue to support Ukraine in meeting its urgent battlefield needs and long-term defense requirements.\" As soon as it became evident that Ukraine's counterattack was not working, Washington and the Pentagon were concentrating on \"long-term defense.\" The passing of Biden's latest supplemental funding requests has been hindered by disagreements over Israel and Ukraine funding. Austin has been to Kiev twice in the past, firstly due to the Russian invasion. \"Today, I am here to make it clear that the United States will remain steadfast in their fight to free Ukraine from the aggression of Russia, both currently and in the future,\" he said. CIA Director William Burns traveled to Ukraine without prior notice to hold urgent meetings with Zelensky and top military and intelligence officials last week. The Asia Times has reported that the surge in activity is a result of the dire situation on the battlefield. A 'proxy war' against Russia has been waged by Washington, costing billions of dollars. The War in Ukraine is set to start on Z-Day on Wednesday, November 15th, as reported by Asia Times. Urgent, covert meetings with Zelensky will be held by CIA Chief William Burns in Kiev. What is the reason for Burns' urgent trip to Ukraine? The answer to the question is that Ukraine is imploding. The collapse of the Zelensky regime is not a surprise as Ukraine has been suffering from such high number of casualties that it is unlikely to survive for much longer. Either Ukraine can make peace with Russia or it could face an internal rebellion. Recent media reports and rumors suggest that Washington is slowly but surely urging Kiev to participate in negotiations. Were Burns and Austin's recent visits aimed at this particular topic? According to the Asia Times, the Russians are attempting to cause a political crisis in Kiev by cutting off Ukraine's armed forces. \"Both Moscow and Washington are astonished at how quickly the Russian effort is moving.\" Zelensky has recently sacked and replaced many members in his own war cabinet. The escalation of friction is reflected in this, and Zelensky has conceded that the Gaza crisis has deflected global attention from Ukraine's war efforts. This has resulted in a decrease in financial and military aid.\n\nAvailable Roles and Subroles:\n\n    Protagonist: Guardian, Martyr, Peacemaker, Rebel, Underdog, Virtuous.\n    Antagonist: Instigator, Conspirator, Tyrant, Foreign Adversary, Traitor, Spy, Saboteur, Corrupt, Incompetent, Terrorist, Deceiver, Bigot.\n    Innocent: Forgotten, Exploited, Victim, Scapegoat.\n\nInstructions:\n\n    - The entity can belong to only one of the three main roles: Protagonist, Antagonist, or Neutral.\n    - Each main role has its own unique set of subroles.

Compromised aficionados who have aligned themselves with the globalist inclination and depend on Davos for guidance are fully financed and compensated. Witnessing elite individuals in \u201cmask off\u201d moments can be a terrifying experience. A top CDC official's video highlights the need for the elites to eliminate all whites in the United States and replace them with immigrants to create a more tolerant society. During a panel discussion in New York City, Dr. Carol Baker provided an explanation for the \"solution.\" In 2009, Baker was appointed by Barack Obama's Health and Human Services Secretary as the Chair of the Advisory Committee on Immunization at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal was presented to her in D.C. at a 2019 ceremony organized by Pfizer and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Is it surprising that a CDC official, who has connections to Bill Gates, is openly advocating for the removal of white people from America who do not align with the elite's vaccine agenda? The individual who informed world leaders about the need for \"death panels\" that will sentence regular, law-abiding individuals to death for their inability to benefit the elite is Bill Gates. The psychopathic world that Bill Gates and his WEF colleagues are striving to enter as part of their Great Reset and Great Replacement is presented here. The situation worsens as you comprehend the extent to which their wicked ideology has been disseminated. The globalist elite is not concealing their intention to depopulate the world by reducing the number of white people.

It is not permissible to discuss the human tragedy caused by Biden and Harris' open border, even if biden lays out his replacement vision in plain language for everyone to understand in 2015. For decades, Biden has been shamelessly selling America to the globalists as a compromised puppet politician. The global elite now consider us to be extremely foolish after sacrificing him in favor of Kamala Harris and replacing him with a body double who is approximately eight inches taller than the previous version. They are of the opinion that we are neglecting the evidence that proves the multi-pronged attacks that harm and kill the population have a shared cause. The targeting of white people by chemtrails and mRNA is statistically unfeasible, unless it is intentional. The plan to wipe out the world's population has been carefully orchestrated. The Covid vaccines have been unveiled as a bioweapon intended to depopulate the planet by culling the herd. Nevertheless, it worsens even more, as explained by Robert F. Kennedy in New York City.

According to Putin, the current problems arose after the Soviet Union's collapse, when Russia attempted to destabilize its internal political situation through the use of international terrorists.

Despite this, Putin asserted that Russia had been making efforts to establish connections with both Western nations and Ukraine for a long time.
