Violent clashes in Baymak— NEXTA (@nexta_tv) January 17, 2024\n\nLaw enforcers used stun grenades in Baymak, Bashkortostan, Russia. The demonstrators responded by throwing snow and ice at them and forced them to retreat. It is reported that negotiations are underway between the protesters and special forces: the law… pic.twitter.com/AVHf2gBi7w\n\nAlsynov’s conviction for inciting ethnic hatred sparked rare large-scale protests in Russia, where the risk of arrest typically stifles such demonstrations. Reports suggest thousands participated in the multi-day protest in -20°C temperatures, resulting in several injuries. The activist denies the charges related to insulting migrants during a demonstration against gold mining plans. Supporters claim the case is retaliation for Alsynov’s activism against soda mining in a culturally significant area. He allegedly referred to Central Asians and Caucasians, comprising a significant portion of Russia’s migrant population, as “black people” in the Bashkir language. Alsynov contends the Bashkir words meant “poor people” and were mistranslated into Russian. He plans to appeal the verdict. Alsynov has previously criticized military mobilization in the region as “genocide” against the Bashkir people. Ongoing concerns exist about the disproportionate deployment of ethnic minorities, including Bashkirs, in conflicts such as Ukraine. Alsynov was a leader of Bashkort, a grassroots movement focused on preserving Bashkir ethnic identity, which was banned as extremist in 2020. The clashes signify a rare instance of public dissent in Russia, underscoring the intensity of emotions surrounding Alsynov’s case and broader issues of ethnic identity and activism in the country.\n\nTask:\nSummarize the main ideas of the text.",

And for Western countries, this is not simply an expense. This is not about accounting, it's about the future.\" Zelenskiy said Ukraine on Friday shot down the 200th Russian aircraft of the war and he noted Russia's heavy losses in tanks, armoured vehicles, helicopters and drones. \"And for what? So that the Lenin statue can stand for a bit longer in temporarily occupied Genichesk? There is and can be no other result for Russia.\" Russian forces in April restored the Lenin statue in Genichesk, a town in the southern Kherson region.

Of course, we are doing everything to evacuate all of the rest, each of our defenders.

This time the news agency accuses the Daily Sceptic of “cherry-picking” Arctic sea ice extent data to provide a “misleading” story. Being accused of “cherry picking” by an outfit that funds a course for journalists that encourages them to pick a fruit such as a mango and discuss why it isn’t as tasty as the year before due to climate change is beyond ridicule. Taking lectures on responsible journalism from a Net Zero-obsessed operation that has promoted a course speaker who has suggested “fines and imprisonments” for expressing scepticism about “well supported” science is laughable, if also a tad sinister. One of the activists called to admonish the Daily Sceptic with a ‘straw man’ argument was Walt Meier, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, who said: “Comparing two specific years is not an indicator for or against long-term changes”. The Daily Sceptic did not do that. Interestingly, this would appear to be the same Walt Meier whose comments on ”mind blowing” low winter levels of Antarctica sea ice last year made headlines around the world. Meier claimed at the time that it was “outside anything we have seen”. Happily, the Daily Sceptic was able to remind Meier that he had been part of a team a decade ago that cracked open the secrets of early Nimbus weather satellites and found a similar sea ice low in 1966. At the time, Meier commented that the Nimbus data show there is variability in Antarctica sea ice “that’s larger than any we have seen” since 1979.

Fonda was castigated by locals, ambushed by a social media reporter and criticized by a left-leaning provincial premier. On Wednesday, at an Edmonton, Alberta news conference, she condemned a fellow-progressive, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying that “people shouldn’t be fooled by good-looking Liberals,” and accused him of “betraying” the Paris climate agreement. Fonda claimed that, like President Barack Obama, her first impression of Trudeau was one of admiration: “When I heard that your prime minister, the shining hope at the … Paris climate talks, who talked so beautifully about needing to meet the requirements of the climate treaty, and respect and hold to the treaties with the Indigenous people, and so forth — such a heroic stance he took there,” Fonda said. “And yet he has betrayed every one of the things that he committed to in Paris. “I guess the lesson is we shouldn’t be fooled by good-looking liberals, no matter how well spoken they are. What a disappointment.”\n\nBut there was disappointment in the remarks of Alberta’s premier, Rachel Notley, who leads the left-leaning provincial New Democratic Party. She called Fonda “tone deaf” and “ill-informed.”\n\nFonda received an invitation from the Alberta government to discuss the oil sands but she refused. “I would suggest if someone was going to come to Alberta … [and] fly over a city that is going through a significant economic downturn, that’s just been through the largest natural disaster in the history of Canada, and then lecture them about where they should get jobs elsewhere, first of all, that’s super tone deaf,” Notley said. On the first day of her oil sands protest, as she strolled through nearby Fort McMurray, Fonda was ambushed by social media reporter Robbie Picard. Picard, who hosts the Facebook group OilSands Strong, peppered Fonda with questions about the oil sands, asking her if she was aware of how many First Nations businesses have invested money in the project. The episode was captured on video by a CBC journalist who was attempting to interview the actress. Fonda did not address any of the questions but insisted, “I’m on your side.”\n\nTask:\nSummarize the main ideas of the text.",

The single or \"biggest loser\" of the Russia-Ukraine conflicts which triggered EU sanctions against Russia is Europe and the U.S. is the winner of the conflicts, said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, reiterating his stand in an interview with Hungarian television on Friday. He pointed out that the EU is not brave enough to admit that its sanctions policy is wrong, and Hungary is not capable enough to change the position of other larger countries, so sanctions against Russia, though ineffective, are likely to remain in place. Orban previously said that Europe, for its ally the U.S., gave up Russian energy and was forced to pay 5 to 10 times of fee for energy, which had also driven up inflation. According to the data published by the Hungarian central statistics office on Friday, Hungary's average consumer price index (CPI) rose by 14.5 percent in 2022, compared with 5.1 percent in 2021. And Hungary's CPI in December 2022 rose by 24.5 percent compared with the same month in 2021, the highest increase since March 1996. Food prices in Hungary also rose by 44.8 percent in December 2022, compared to the same month in 2021. Since the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict, Europe has encountered a severe energy crisis. Bloomberg reported that Europe lost one trillion U.S. dollars by rejecting Russian energy while the U.S. is selling its LNG to Europe at three to four times the price in the U.S., which drew criticism from French President Emmanuel Macron, saying it is a practice that \"is not what true friends would do and must stop.\" Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto had said the beneficiary of Europe's recession is the U.S.\n\nTask:\nSummarize the main ideas of the text.",

The single or \"biggest loser\" of the Russia-Ukraine conflicts which triggered EU sanctions against Russia is Europe and the U.S. is the winner of the conflicts, said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, reiterating his stand in an interview with Hungarian television on Friday. He pointed out that the EU is not brave enough to admit that its sanctions policy is wrong, and Hungary is not capable enough to change the position of other larger countries, so sanctions against Russia, though ineffective, are likely to remain in place. Orban previously said that Europe, for its ally the U.S., gave up Russian energy and was forced to pay 5 to 10 times of fee for energy, which had also driven up inflation. According to the data published by the Hungarian central statistics office on Friday, Hungary's average consumer price index (CPI) rose by 14.5 percent in 2022, compared with 5.1 percent in 2021. And Hungary's CPI in December 2022 rose by 24.5 percent compared with the same month in 2021, the highest increase since March 1996. Food prices in Hungary also rose by 44.8 percent in December 2022, compared to the same month in 2021. Since the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict, Europe has encountered a severe energy crisis. Bloomberg reported that Europe lost one trillion U.S. dollars by rejecting Russian energy while the U.S. is selling its LNG to Europe at three to four times the price in the U.S., which drew criticism from French President Emmanuel Macron, saying it is a practice that \"is not what true friends would do and must stop.\" Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto had said the beneficiary of Europe's recession is the U.S.\n\nTask:\nSummarize the main ideas of the text.",

Italian press reports she rejected Hungary’s Fidesz party joining the ECR group in the EU parliament \n\n A report from Italy claims that Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has rejected Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s efforts to join the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group in the European Parliament. Meloni is currently serving as leader of the group, which is made up of a wide range of conservative and center-right parties across Europe. However, according to Italian press outlet Corriere della Sera, Meloni sees more disadvantages than advantages to Orbán joining the group. One of the main sticking points is Orbán’s pro-peace position on the war in Ukraine. He remains opposed to sending weapons to Ukraine and is calling for an immediate ceasefire; in contrast, Meloni is pushing for more weapons and continued war against Russia, which has made her somewhat of a darling of the Brussels elite, who see her as someone they can work with, including on the issue of migration. Meloni herself has taken a notable U-turn on the issue of migration, calling for more legal migration to Italy and overseeing a huge increase in illegal migration under her rule. Meloni is looking to grow the ECR from the sixth-largest grouping in the EU parliament to the third largest. Among the parties belonging to the group are Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS), who have also shunned Orbán’s views on the war in Ukraine. The stance of other parties may have also played a role in Meloni’s decision to exclude Orbán from the group. It is unclear how Orbán and his Fidesz party will react to Meloni’s rejection. So far, only Corriere della Sera has reported on the issue, but there has been no denial from either camp over the issue. I\n\nTask:\nSummarize the main ideas of the text.",

According to the FT, Washington has been Kyiv’s major source of military aid. US officials interviewed by the newspaper say the remaining funds preapproved by Congress could sustain Ukraine for about another five months. Western officials in regular contact with the US over Ukraine told the FT that Washington sees that period of time as the last real chance for Kyiv to change the situation on the ground. “We can’t keep the same level of assistance forever,” a European official told the British newspaper as he argued that the current level of support could be sustained for another year or possibly two years but no more. Politico reported earlier this week that only $6 billion of the original $48 billion military aid package that the US had approved previously now remains. According to the US publication, Washington’s funds for Kyiv may be fully allocated by mid-summer. European allies are increasingly uncertain about whether the US will come close to matching its existing $48bn package, adopted in 2022, particularly as it requires a vote in Congress this autumn against the backdrop of more partisan debate on the war, FT reported. Recently, European leaders promised Zelenskyy an arsenal of missiles, tanks and drones during a whirlwind three-day visit to Italy, the Vatican, Germany, France and the U.K. that sought to replenish Ukraine’s depleted weapons supplies ahead of a long-anticipated spring offensive aimed at turning the tide of the war. Zelenskyy’s energetic international diplomacy over 15 months of war has persuaded Ukraine’s Western allies to send ever more powerful weapons, from German Leopard tanks to U.S. Patriot missile systems and Storm Shadow cruise missiles from the U.K. The war in Ukraine that began a year ago has killed thousands, forced millions to flee their homes, reduced entire cities to rubble and has fuelled fears the confrontation could slide into an open conflict between Russia and NATO.

Chief Guterres Decries ‘Climate-Related Carnage’ from ‘Apocalyptic Flooding’ \n\n The United Nations alarmist-in-chief António Guterres has denounced “climate-related carnage” in Pakistan caused by “apocalyptic flooding.”\n\nApparently unable to sympathize with those in need without invoking the bogeyman of global warming, Guterres took advantage of Pakistan’s flooding plight to advance his crusade against the “climate crisis.”\n\n“I will never forget the climate-related carnage I saw after apocalyptic flooding submerged a third of Pakistan,” the U.N. chief declared Wednesday on Twitter (now X). “I call on donors & international financial institutions to make good on their funding pledges in support of recovery efforts as soon as possible.”\n\nIn a separate Tweet Wednesday, the veteran Portuguese socialist asserted that the “climate emergency is threatening the very survival of communities & economies that depend on tourism,” before touting “green investments” as well as “investing in sustainable tourism.”\n\nAccording to the U.N. Secretary-General, those working for real Climate Action are “on the right side of history” since the battle to stop global warming constitutes the “fight of our lives.”\n\nGuterres’ bombast has been heating up much faster than the environment. Just this month, Guterres said that humanity must urgently find solutions to climate change because it “has opened the gates of hell.”\n\n“Horrendous heat is having horrendous effects,” Guterres warned in his opening remarks at the U.N. Climate Ambition Summit in New York. “Distraught farmers watching crops carried away by floods; sweltering temperatures spawning disease; and thousands fleeing in fear as historic fires rage.”\n\nThis summer, he said that “the era of global warming has ended, the era of global boiling has arrived” (emphasis added). He also claimed that the “dog days of summer are not just barking, they are biting,” adding that the “climate breakdown has begun.”\n\nGuterres has placed the blame for the climate crisis on “our fossil fuel addiction,” insisting that “climate is imploding faster than we can cope.”\n\nWhile wild hyperbole and theatrical rhetoric may work in advertising, one cannot help but wonder whether they do not diminish the seriousness of Mr. Guterres’ case and indeed of his office.
