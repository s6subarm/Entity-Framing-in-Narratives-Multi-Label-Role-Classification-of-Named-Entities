This code base is a part of a larger project titled "Entity Framing in Narratives: Multi-Label Role Classification of Named Entities". This project is conducted as a part of the course work for "Introduction to Natural Language Processing" at the University of Bonn during Winter24/25 semester.

### Project: Entity Framing in Narratives: Multi-Label Role Classification of Named Entities


### Problem Overview
Given a news article and a named entity, the task is to classify the entity into one of three main roles: protagonist, antagonist, or innocent. Additionally, each main role has associated fine-grained roles that must also be predicted. This makes the task a multi-class, multi-label classification problem. Most existing approaches address either multi-class or multi-label problems separately, but few tackle both simultaneously. This motivated us to explore different models to see how they perform when solving both tasks together.
